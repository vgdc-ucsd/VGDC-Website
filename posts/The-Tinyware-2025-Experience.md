Hello everyone! Welcome to the final blog post of the '24 - '25 academic year! We've just wrapped up TinyWare, VGDC's 48 hour in person game jam. To take your mind off of the impending approach of finals week, we took the time to speak to as many teams as possible throughout the jam and gathered their thoughts on the whole experience!

## TinyWare - Day One

<i>**TinyWare's just started. How are you feeling?**</i>

**Team Weapons of Mass Destruction:** "Honestly, I'm feeling good. I made good progress, so things are looking a little better than I anticipated. I had an idea coming in, and it's coming together well. I think I'll be proud of how this went."

**Team Weapons of Mass Destruction:** "I'm really excited! This is actually my first game jam, so I'm trying really hard to do well." 

<i>**Do you think you'll be able to get your game done in time?**</i>

**Team AAAA:** "I mean, 48 hours is such a short amount of time, and this is only the second game that I've ever attempted to make. But I think that the amount of ideas that we've brainstormed so far makes me pretty confident that we can finish the game on time." 

**Team AAAA:** "I'm pretty confident in our ability to make a minimum viable product that's going to be fun. Our idea is there, and we already have our core features implemented. To really flesh out the basic things that we need is going to take very little work, so I'm confident that we can do it." 

<i>**How do you feel about your game?**</i>

**Team Homunculus:** "I think we're cooking."

## TinyWare - Day Two

<i>**It's the second day, and it's 1:35 a.m. How's progress going?**</i>

**Team Chase's Car Door:** "I'm feeling great. Our project is going well, we made good progress. I'm very confident in it. It's definitely a bit late, and I should probably get to bed, but you know VGDC — you can't not stay up until absurd hours." 

<i>**How's your game right now? Have you encountered any challenges?**</i>

**Nick Mitroff (Solo):** "Honestly, my game is looking really good. I'm actually proud of it right now."
 
**Nick Mitroff:** "I was trying to implement a custom physics system for my game, but the player kept clipping into walls. I ended up just reworking the game so the player didn't collide with walls at all, and it seems to have worked out." 

<i>**How much time have you spent working on your game? Is it going well?**</i>

**Team VP Finance:** "I'm tired. We started around 6:30 p.m. the first day and then stayed until like, 3:40 a.m.? That was about nine hours, almost ten. Today, we worked from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. So we've been working for thirteen hours."

**Team VP Finance:** "In total, we've worked for about 24 hours — that's crazy. Progress is going okay, we got a minimum viable product done, so we're almost there."

**Team VP Finance:** "We've only gotten this far because my teammate is amazing. He's the best. Only fellow treasurers could cook up a game like this."

## Day 3

<i>**We're only a couple of hours from the deadline. How are things going?**</i>

**Team Homunculus:** "I think our team is doing great. We've made a lot of progress. I'm really proud of how much we've been able to accomplish in such a short amount of time. I'm really looking forward to seeing how our game turns out." 

<i>**Has your team had to overcome any challenges?**</i>

**Team MIT:** "There've been many, many, many problems. We've had minimal success for most of the jam. But we're pulling through, and we're cooking right now. We're in a good spot, the game should be finished in about an hour and a half."

**Team MIT:** "We had to redesign our whole game, like, thirty hours into this forty-eight hour game jam. It was not great. But, we're going to pull through, one hundred percent."

<i>**Congratulations on winning the award for Audience's Choice tonight! What was the process of making your game like?**</i>

**Ethan Carter (Solo):** "It was an idea that I had been sitting on for a while. The mechanic of the quantum objects was heavily inspired by a game called Outer Wilds. You should totally play it, it's an awesome game." 

**Ethan Carter:** "When I heard the theme, I started thinking about it again, and the gears in my head just started turning. I thought, what if you're looking at something, and when you look back at it again, things change?' 

**Ethan Carter:** "The development process was a lot of fun. It's very stressful, but I love the grind. I'm really happy to have won the award. Frankly, there were a lot of awesome games."

**Ethan Carter:** "I love this club. It's awesome. I'm really glad that I got to be a part of this event."
