Welcome back everyone, happy spring quarter! We hope your break was as fun as it was relaxing. Today, we're going to be going over events and projects we have planned for the last quarter of the academic year. We've got a lot of exciting things in store, so you should keep reading until the end!  

## Game Development Projects

We're starting the quarter's game development projects with our TritonWare Kickoff, taking place on April 4th! It'll mark the official start of TritonWare, our two week long game jam. The event itself will be a chance for everyone participating to meet one another, allowing participants to form teams and get started on brainstorming for their game right away. Keep an eye on the announcements channel in our Discord for more information soon! 

If you want to be involved with a long term project, we're picking up where we left off with TCP on April 25th! Work is set to continue on the remaining stages from week 4 onwards, so whether you're a veteran or new to the project, come by the event to learn about the Projects Committee's plan for it this quarter! If you're unfamiliar with TCP, we recommend reading [this](https://www.vgdc.dev/news/Making-Mariposa) blog post. 

We're eager to get started, but we also realize that the idea of diving into projects like these can feel like a big step. Luckily, we have some workshops planned to help you prepare!

## Workshops & Tutorials

In case you're using Unity, we'll be uploading a set of tutorials to our YouTube channel going over some key steps to kickstart your TritonWare Project! They're being taught by Ethan, one of our current Programming leads. These are especially good for anyone just getting started. They're being uploaded a few days before TritonWare, so we encourage watching these videos if you're planning on participating. 

Following closely is our Writing Workshop on April 8th, spearheaded by Jess, our Writing Lead! We'll be talking about how to write dialogue for NPCs alongside a quick crash course in writing screenplays - this is a particularly good workshop for anyone currently a part of or interested in joining TCP's writing team! 

Further into the month, we'll be collaborating with our friends at ArtSpark to host a Character Design Workshop, led by Chanel and Kaylee of ArtSpark! Drop in on April 29th to learn the process of designing a character, open to anyone of any skill level! Having visually memorable characters can go a long way in helping your game stand out, so attending this workshop could really benefit you in the long term.  

## Social Events

We're incredibly excited for everything mentioned, but it's also important to us that aspiring game developers have a chance to meet each other. That's why we have a few events planned with an emphasis on socializing! 

Early into the quarter is our Spring GBM, taking place on April 2nd! Stop by to hear more about events mentioned in this post. There'll be time dedicated after the presentation for people to walk around and talk to one another, so this is a really good opportunity to meet people with a similar interest in the medium. 

Even if you can't attend our Spring GBM, you'll still have a chance to meet other game developers on campus at our Summer Sendoff, happening on June 4th! Drop by for a night of fun as we celebrate both the record-breaking and innovative year we've had at VGDC, and how far all members have come. Last year, we completely shattered attendance expectations and had an amazing time all around, so you really don't want to miss out on this one!

## Future Blog Posts & Recruitment 

Believe us when we say we have exciting plans for the blog this quarter. Next week, we're taking advantage of how multidisciplinary the medium of video games is by having our first guest writer for our topics in video game development series! We're using these as a chance to deep dive into each aspect that goes into making a game, so if there's a topic you want to see covered, let us know and we'll do our best to make it happen. 

Interested in becoming an officer for VGDC? We're doing recruitment this quarter! Be on the lookout on our Discord and social media for more information. As always, thank you for reading. We hope to see you at some of the events we talked about today. See you next time!
